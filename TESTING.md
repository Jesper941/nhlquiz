Testing was ongoing throughout the entire project. I used the Chrome developer tools while coding the website to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues.

I have gone through each step of the quiz using Google Chrome developer tools to ensure that each page is responsive on a variety of different screen sizes and devices.
